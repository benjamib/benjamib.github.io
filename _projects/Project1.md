The Hex Map Editor asset is the first commercial project created by <span class="title"><span class="red">Make</span> + <span class="green">Learn</span> = <span class="yellow">Fun</span></span>. The Hex Map Editor is an Unity Editor Script that allows users to create Hex Maps easily. The asset will be easy to integrate into games and other projects and allows for easy map editing right in the Unity editor. Users will be able to paint Hex cells, raise the elevation of cells, and easily place prefabs on cells. This asset will be the first in a series of assets that will build upong the Hex Map base. 
 
The entire development process can be followed through our <b>[Blog](https://benjamib.github.io/blog/)</b>

In addition to following the development on the blog, there will be occasional <b>[YouTube videos](https://benjamib.github.io/videos/)</b> posted to chronicle our development as well as to demonstrate the game as it progresses. 

I hope you join me in this development journey!
