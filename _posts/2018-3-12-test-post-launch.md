Hello out there in maker land! We are Make + Learn = Fun{:.title}, a resource for makers of all ages. We want to give
you access to awesome projects, fun instructional videos, and a fun podcast all focused on making, learning, and having fun.

You might be wondering, what is a Maker? Traditionally the term maker refers to those intrepid DIYers who hole themselves up in garages or workshops or makerspaces and weld and solder, tinker and build. Here at Make + Learn = Fun{:.title} we believe that a maker is simply someone who makes things. Art, technology, crafts, food, literature, music. Kids are the most prolific and imaginative makers off all. They make at every opportunity and we hope to help inspire them and use making as a tool for learning about the world.

This is your place to keep up to date on news, links, and new projects, videos or podcasts from Make + Learn = Fun{:.title}.

Happy Making!
